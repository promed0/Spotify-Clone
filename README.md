🎧 Spotify Clone – CSS Project
This project is a sleek and responsive clone of the Spotify desktop interface, built entirely with HTML and CSS—no JavaScript involved. It replicates the core layout and visual design of Spotify’s web player, including the sidebar, album display, playback controls, and volume slider. The goal of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in front-end layout techniques and responsive design while capturing the aesthetic of a real-world application.
